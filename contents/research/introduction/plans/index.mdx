### Our Research Task List

To stay organized and keep moving forward, we’ve outlined key tasks and challenges. This list will expand as we discover new possibilities and navigate current limitations.

---

### Exploring .MESH and .TRIPHYS Files
**Goal**: Develop methods to open and work with `.MESH` and `.TRIPHYS` files.
**Purpose**: By visualizing these models, we can locate and extract module stats for each tank, a crucial step in understanding individual vehicle characteristics and performance.

---

### Unlocking the Garage/Main Menu Camera
**Current Status**: Limited progress with current tools, but we’ve managed to access certain perspectives.
**Objective**: Fully unlocking the main menu and garage camera could open up new exploration possibilities. Check out our recent [main menu box camera post](#) for more on what we’ve uncovered so far. Accessing these areas further could give us deeper insights into hidden game mechanics and interface elements.

---

### Accessing the Garage/Main Menu from the Firing Range
**Challenge**: Reaching the garage or main menu from the firing range is currently not feasible.
**Insight**: The garage area exists in the map data, situated beneath the firing range near the farthest target. In our [firing range menu box post](#), we managed to get close, but further research is needed to bridge this gap.

---

### Discovering More Hidden Configurations
**Focus**: Inside the `coldwar.project` file, several configurations seem to impact fog distance and potentially other environmental effects.
**Objective**: We’re investigating how these settings affect in-game visibility and exploring possible customizations to enhance gameplay and visuals.

---

### Locating Gameplay Stats Storage
**Task**: Identify where the game stores the stats visible in the loadout menu when pressing TAB.
**Purpose**: Accessing these stored values could provide valuable insights into how the game tracks player performance and other backend mechanics, helping us understand stat handling within the game.

---

### Organizing Findings and Creating Posts
**Plan**: As we continue making discoveries, we’ll document each major finding in detailed posts for the community.
**Benefit**: This process will help us track our progress and make future research easier to manage and reference.

> This roadmap guides our ongoing research into Project CW. We’re excited to tackle these tasks and will keep documenting each milestone as we progress. Stay tuned!
