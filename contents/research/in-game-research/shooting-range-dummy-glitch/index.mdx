title: "Titan Dummies Respawn Glitch"
description: "Investigating Titan Dummy Behavior in the Firing Range"
---

In version 0.9.8, an intriguing glitch has emerged involving the Titan dummies in the firing range. After being destroyed, these dummies respawn at the normal player spawn point, leaving behind a ghost tank in their original location. This behavior raises questions about the mechanics of spawning and the conditions that trigger this unintended effect.

### A Closer Look at the Respawn Mechanism

In our first video, we capture the moment when a Titan dummy is destroyed. Rather than simply disappearing, the game attempts to instantly respawn the tank at its original location. However, due to a lack of space, it instead spawns on top of another existing dummy, resulting in a chaotic clustering of tanks at the player spawn point.

### Underlying Cause: Space Constraints

Though the exact cause of this glitch remains unconfirmed, it appears that when checking for available spawn space, the dead body of the destroyed dummy does not despawn immediately. Consequently, the game identifies the player's spawn point as the only valid location for the new dummy, leading to this strange behavior.
Our second video demonstrates this effect more closely as we attempt to push the dummies around, showcasing the interactions that occur in this glitchy scenario.

As we continue to analyze these mechanics, we aim to provide valuable insights that could help the community better understand the game's spawning system and identify potential areas for improvement. Stay tuned for more findings as we delve deeper into the intricacies of Project CW!
