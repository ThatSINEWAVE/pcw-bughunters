title: Tank Module Locations & More
description: In this post, we delve into the critical modules of various tanks and their effects when damaged. Each module, from the ammo rack to the engine, plays a vital role in your tank's performance and survivability. Understanding where to target and how critical hits can affect your gameplay is essential for mastering your strategy. We'll also provide a detailed overview of module locations and the corresponding crit effects for different tanks, helping you optimize your approach in combat scenarios.
