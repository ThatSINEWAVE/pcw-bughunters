After conducting some tests with HSTV-L inside the firing range, we've discovered that the room showcasing tanks in the main menu is located beneath the firing range map. Our next objective is to determine whether we can access this hidden room and drive around inside it. This exploration not only reveals intriguing elements of the game’s architecture but also raises questions about the potential for gameplay mechanics involving these hidden spaces.

### Locating the Main Garage

We’ve showcased our finding in a video that serves as the proof of concept for the garage's location. This clip highlights the initial finding and placement of the garage area.

### Closer Inspection

In a second video, we take a closer look at the garage. Successfully landing in the area requires maneuvering the titan closer to the edge of the firing range to ensure that the tank can remain near it. This closer examination offers insight into the design choices made by the developers and hints at how players might interact with this hidden space in future updates.
