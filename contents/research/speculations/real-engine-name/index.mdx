title: "Discovery of CoreX in Project CW"
description: "In this post, we uncover evidence suggesting that Project CW may be powered by an upgraded version of Wargaming's Core engine, known as CoreX. From console logs to the role of a key developer, we dive into how this new engine could be transforming Project CW’s gameplay and graphics."

### Experimenting with Dev Mode

While experimenting to force Project CW into some kind of editor or dev mode, the console logs unexpectedly showed the name "CoreX" instead of the commonly referenced "broEngine." This revelation led us to dig deeper into the engine’s origins.

### A Connection to Wargaming's Core Engine

The "CoreX" name caught our attention because it closely resembles Wargaming's "Core" engine, which powers World of Tanks. This well-known engine, originally released by Wargaming to elevate World of Tanks' graphics and performance, seemed to share common elements with what we observed in Project CW.

### Tracing the Lead Developer

To further investigate, we looked into Wargaming’s development team and found an interesting link. Alexey Vasilkov, who led the Graphics Core Engine Development Team from June 2014 to March 2021, transitioned to a Tech Lead role in the CoreX Engine Department in April 2021. This timing aligns closely with the first sightings and leaks of Project CW.

### CoreX: An Evolution of Wargaming’s Core Engine?

The timing of Vasilkov’s shift to CoreX development suggests that Project CW’s "broEngine" may actually be a codename for CoreX—a potentially enhanced, upgraded version of World of Tanks' Core engine. This upgraded tech could be laying the foundation for Project CW, bringing a new level of performance and sophistication to the game.
