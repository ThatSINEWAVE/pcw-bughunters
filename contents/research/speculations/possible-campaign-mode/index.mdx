### The Discovery

While examining the game files, two videos labeled `first_login` were found. These videos align perfectly when placed end to end, suggesting they may serve as an intro or cinematic sequence. Notably, only one of these videos currently appears in the game.

### The Clues

In the video above, one frame displays a map marked with the coordinates **10°45'45.4"N, 106°39'36.6"E**, pointing to **Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City**. These coordinates may be a critical hint toward the game’s setting.

</div>

Additionally, a piece of handwritten text in the same frame could provide more insights, although it remains partially undeciphered.

### The Research

Upon searching these coordinates, we located a region in Vietnam similar to what appears in the video, though there’s a slight discrepancy. The coordinates **10°45'45.4"N, 106°39'36.6"E** don’t perfectly match the area found, which actually sits at **10.589127684283982, 106.8835646611013**.

Historical topology maps from the Vietnam War further align with the video’s terrain.

#### The T-55 Enigma

An additional interesting element in the video is the appearance of T-55 tanks. This specific tank, identified as the T-55 "Enigma," is only seen in the game’s tutorial mission, suggesting it might play a significant role in a possible campaign.

#### Voice Lines

We’ve also identified three distinct voice lines: two in English and one in another language, possibly Russian or Vietnamese. The lines reference a significant crash involving a C-5 Galaxy, hinting at a disaster involving a nuclear reactor (ML-2).

### What We Know So Far

- **Location**: Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
- **Timeline**: Likely 1964-1969

The files also contain an invasion map from 1964 and imagery associated with the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which aligns with the video footage and references found.

Another file shows a map that matches an actual location in Ho Chi Minh City, yet it hasn’t appeared in the game itself.
