### What’s Inside Our Tank Stats Spreadsheet?

Our spreadsheet provides a deep dive into tank stats for *Project CW*, covering every detail we’ve been able to pull together so far. Using in-game testing, datamining, and a bit of investigative work, we’ve formatted each tank’s data into an accessible layout so you can dig into the details.

[Access the sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11LqjjvHzQIkLn5yyki5QpqMCC_vEjhdKn_lZJYxvA9I/edit?gid=8521183#gid=8521183)

Here's a quick look at some of the stats you’ll find in the sheet:

- **Firepower:** From damage to reticle size and reload speed, our Firepower section breaks down everything related to offensive performance. This includes critical values like *Aiming Speed*, *Damage*, *Penetration*, and more.

- **Mobility:** Covers everything from *Forward Speed* and *Acceleration* to more niche aspects like *Sprint Regen Rate* and *Traverse Speed*. It’s all here to give you insight into what makes each tank tick in terms of movement.

- **Survivability:** You’ll find the tank’s *Hit Points*, *Crit Damage* resistances, and *Repair Times* for various systems, offering a solid overview of each tank's endurance.

- **Recon:** Everything you need to know about spotting, from *Spotting Range* to *X-Ray Radius*, is covered here.

- **Utility:** A look at the extra tools each tank brings to the field, including *Energy Points*, *Smoke Cooldowns*, and other unique abilities.

### Overall Vehicle Stats Table

We’ve also created an overall stats table that rolls everything up into a single score for categories like *Firepower*, *Mobility*, *Recon*, *Toughness*, and *Utility*. This table gives a quick glance at each vehicle’s potential, although it’s still a work in progress. With the game in development, some of these scores may need revisiting, especially as values are further adjusted during upcoming playtests.

### How We Collected This Data

Every number in our spreadsheet comes from a combination of in-game testing, menu values, and some datamining techniques. Many of the hidden stats we’ve discovered weren’t readily available in the game’s visible menus, so we've gone the extra mile to make sure the sheet is as complete as possible for the community.

The stats are likely to shift as *Project CW* evolves, so stay tuned!
