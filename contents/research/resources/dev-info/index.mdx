### The Goal

In this post, we’re collecting publicly shared information from the developers of *Project CW*, gathered through casual conversations in the official Discord server. These insights were shared openly with the entire community, providing us a deeper look into the mechanics, weaponry, and in-game assets. This information is not exclusive to the PCW Bug Hunters but accessible to all players who followed the discussions.

#### Damage Roll Information

</div>

In one of the discussions, Murazor, a developer, confirmed that the damage roll for weapons currently has a range of ±15%. This percentage means that any attack has a slight random variance in its damage output, allowing for some unpredictability in combat scenarios. This detail gives players a better understanding of the game’s mechanics and the slight fluctuations they might notice during gameplay.

#### Facts About Kent’s Shell

In another conversation, Murazor shared an image of how Kent's shell looks in real-life to illustrate its design. This cross-section photo shows the intricate build and structure of the shell, giving players an authentic glimpse into how in-game ammunition corresponds to actual military technology. This insight bridges the gap between the game and real-world weaponry, adding to the immersive experience.

#### Raketa and Helicopter Cannibalization

</div>

MikeRTV offered insights into the Raketa vehicle's unique design, revealing that it features TV3-117 helicopter engines sourced from an Mi-24 helicopter. In addition to the engines, other components like fuel and oil tanks, windshields, and body parts were also reused from helicopters. The turret-mounted rocket pods are reminiscent of modifications seen on T-62 tanks used in Afghanistan, further reflecting the developers' inspiration from real-world military adaptations.

### The Conclusion

This post offers a glimpse into the kind of details the developers share with the community, enhancing our understanding of *Project CW*’s design and mechanics. We will continue to update this post as more information surfaces, ensuring that our knowledge base grows along with the game. Stay tuned for further insights straight from the dev team!
