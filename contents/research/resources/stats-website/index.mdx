### What is PCWStats?
PCWStats is our take on a stats site for *Project CW*, inspired by tools like tanks.gg for *World of Tanks*. Built by ThatSINEWAVE on GitHub (SINEWAVE in the community), it’s meant to give players easy access to in-game data and tools for better gameplay insights.

### What You’ll Find on PCWStats

Here’s what’s currently available on the site:

- **Full Vehicle Stats:**
  PCWStats has data on every vehicle, including the hidden stats. You can compare vehicles side-by-side, and future updates will support comparisons with upgrades, perks, and abilities to make it even easier to plan builds.

- **Map Details (Still in Progress):**
  We’re working on gathering info for each map in the game, so keep an eye out as we expand this section.

- **Guides from Top Players:**
  A guide section is in the works, featuring tips from some of the best players in the *Project CW* community. These will cover everything from mastering specific vehicles to understanding the game’s mechanics.

- **Player Stats (Coming Soon):**
  We’re planning a player stats area, so you can check your own in-game stats and compare with others. Not quite ready yet, but it’s on the way.

### Early Beta – Ongoing Development

PCWStats is still in early beta. Right now, we’ve paused development until the next playtest so we can see where *Project CW* heads next. For now, check it out and explore what’s up so far at [PCWStats](https://thatsinewave.github.io/PCWStats/).

More updates will come as *Project CW* evolves!
