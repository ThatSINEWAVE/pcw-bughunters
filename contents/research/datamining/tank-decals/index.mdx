### Decal Sets Uncovered

Through recent file exploration, we’ve found several decal sets for various tanks in Project CW. One of the most notable finds is **Chopper**, which has two distinct decal styles—one with black text and the other with white. This could hint at potential customization options down the line, though for now, it's a fascinating look into the aesthetic diversity the developers might be experimenting with.

### The Editing Challenge

While these decal variations are exciting, any attempts to edit or replace textures are currently blocked. **Sentry**, the game’s anti-tamper system, automatically replaces any altered textures with a “NOT FOUND” placeholder image, enforcing strict file checks that prevent visual modifications.

### Decal Set Gallery

Below, you’ll find a gallery of the discovered tank decals, showcasing each unique design:

### Looking Ahead

While we can’t edit these decals yet, the discovery of these files raises exciting possibilities. If Project CW opens up texture customization in the future, players could enjoy more personalization options for their tanks. Until then, these decals give us a preview of what may lie ahead in terms of tank design and style.
