title: "Hunting for potential hidden servers"
description: "A look at the main server addresses used by the game, including a potential private dev-only server. Odd results from a recent port scan reveal only one active port, here’s what we found."

### The Discovery

In version Alpha V0.0.59.3318, we discovered that the main server address used by the game is **gate.projectcw.dev** running on **port 27100**. Currently, we’ve also discovered an additional server that seems to be a private dev-only server operating on **port 30000**. To find all possible servers, we’d need to perform a deep scan of all ports to see which ones accept connections.

### Known Servers
- **gate.projectcw.dev:27100** - Main playtest server used until version Alpha V0.0.59.3318
- **gate.projectcw.dev:30000** - Private dev-only server found in version Alpha V0.0.58.3308

### Port Scans

After running an initial port scan, the results are a bit odd. It seems that only **port 27100** responds to any type of ping, even though I can still ping **port 30000** within the game.
