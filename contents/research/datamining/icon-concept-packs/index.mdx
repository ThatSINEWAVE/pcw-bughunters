Two distinct sets of icon packs were found within the game files, hinting at potential unused icons that may not have been introduced in the game yet. Further research is needed to determine if these icons are entirely new or if they represent updated versions of existing game elements.

Here are the file names for each set:

These packs could contain assets related to general UI or specific battle functions. Examining these icons might reveal some of the game's planned or scrapped features, adding more context to the game's development direction.
