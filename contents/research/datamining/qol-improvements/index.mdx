## Possible Quality of Life Improvements

While digging through the game files, we found some intriguing screenshots hinting at possible Quality of Life (QoL) improvements. These images showcase a more detailed version of Operations, including a new loadout icon that suggests higher upgrade levels. Here’s a breakdown of what we found:

### Key Discoveries

- **Enhanced Mission Requirements:** Screenshots reveal more complex mission requirements compared to what we currently see in the game.

### Extra Find: Early UI Design

There’s also a bonus discovery! One image show an early version of the game’s UI, which has a totally different style than the one seen in the public alpha test, this image is called `old_air_strike_img_video_preview9cd25b19cc5a215f8d5273c60c202d22` which could hint at what its trying to show but its also odd that its present inside the files.

These elements might suggest future updates or abandoned features, but either way, they’re interesting glimpses into what could have been or whats coming in the future.
