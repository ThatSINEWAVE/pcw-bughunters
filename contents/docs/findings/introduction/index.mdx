## Who is PCW Bug Hunters?

The PCW Bug Hunters is a group of passionate players, programmers, and exploiters committed to identifying and researching bugs within Project CW. Their goal is to provide detailed bug reports directly to the development team, contributing to the overall improvement of the game. The identities of PCW Bug Hunters members remain anonymous, as their work is focused on enhancing the game rather than leaking critical bugs or exploits to the public. Their efforts help ensure that issues are addressed and resolved before being discovered by the wider player base.

### What are we doing?

The content presented on this website highlights the discoveries made by the PCW Bug Hunters group during the first Public Alpha Playtest, which took place from 17/01/2024 to 05/02/2024. It includes our findings on bugs, technical issues, and gameplay mechanics within the game. Our research will resume once the next Public Playtest is announced and available for testing.

### Is the group recruiting?

At the moment, we are not actively recruiting members for the group because there is no active Playtest available to participate in. The recruitment of members for the PCW Bug Hunters group happens on a selective basis. We scout for talented individuals within the public Discord server of the game, focusing on those who demonstrate extensive game knowledge and a passion for finding and reporting bugs. If you are chosen to join the group, you will be directly contacted by SINEWAVE_. Please note, any other individuals claiming to represent our group are either impersonators or attempting to scam you. Always ensure your invitation comes directly from SINEWAVE_ for authenticity.
